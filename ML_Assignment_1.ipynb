    "a) Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n",
    "Definition: Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and mimic human actions. It encompasses a broad                 range of techniques and approaches aiming to enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.\n",
    "Example: AI can be seen in applications like virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa) that can understand natural language, respond to questions, and perform tasks such as setting              reminders or controlling smart home devices. These assistants use AI techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to interpret and respond to            user commands intelligently.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "Definition: Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.             Instead of explicitly programmed instructions, ML algorithms use statistical techniques to learn patterns from data and improve over time.\n",
    "Example: An example of machine learning is in email spam filters. These filters learn from examples of spam and non-spam emails to automatically categorize incoming emails as either          spam or not spam. The algorithm trains on historical data, identifying features (like keywords or email headers) that differentiate between spam and legitimate emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Deep Learning\n",
    "Definition: Deep Learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that involves artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). These networks are                   inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, allowing them to learn from large amounts of data. Deep learning models can automatically discover intricate               patterns and representations in data.\n",
    "Example: Image recognition is a common application of deep learning. For instance, a deep learning model can be trained to recognize objects in images. Initially, it learns basic            features like edges and textures from images and gradually learns more complex features (e.g., shapes, parts of objects) through deeper layers of the network. Applications          include facial recognition in photos, medical image analysis, and autonomous driving systems."
